# Entropy-Based Model for Classification

# Overview
This project leverages advanced machine learning techniques to design a robust classification system. It explores the application of entropy-based features and other preprocessing steps to develop a highly accurate and efficient model. The system integrates multiple components, such as entropy calculations, feature scaling, and cross-validation, to optimize performance. The repository contains Python scripts, Jupyter notebooks, and configuration files to facilitate easy reproduction of the results.

# Motive
The primary goal of this project is to:

Understand the Role of Entropy: Assess how entropy and related metrics contribute to distinguishing classes in datasets.
Develop a Reliable Model: Build a classification model capable of high accuracy, precision, recall, and generalization to unseen data.
Benchmark Results: Test and evaluate the model on various performance metrics, including precision, recall, and F1-score, using cross-validation to validate results rigorously.

# Model
The classification model is developed using the following steps:

# Feature Engineering:

- Entropy-based features are computed using the script 'entropies.py'
- Features are normalized using StandardScaler to standardize the input data.

# Model Architecture:

- A binary classification model implemented in the Jupyter Notebook model.ipynb.
- The model is trained using StratifiedKFold for robust evaluation, ensuring equal representation of classes in all folds.

# Evaluation Metrics:

- The results are evaluated based on precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Cross-validation ensures the model's performance is generalizable to new data.
